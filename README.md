This is my first experimental mod for shoes.

There are two editions: the **common** one and the **cutout** one in which the latter doesn't cover the private parts of the character.

The cutout texture can be exported via Material Editor as MainTex, or found in the folder of this mod. Most of parts in this texture (as well as the texture for the common one) are mapped similar as a skin overlay, so if you import a skin overlay in the MainTex of these shoes, the patterns might be the quite similar. Also, any completely transparent part in the cutout texture will be culled as a hole that lets the body parts under the shoes be uncovered and exposed. You can draw your own cutout texture to reduce the parts of the shoes that you don't want to cover the body. 

In addition, there is a blend shape called "Tight" that can be found in the Blend Shapes tab of adv.mode of HS2PE / AIPE in StudioNeo when you add and select the character wearing these shoes in the scene. You can move the slider if you want it to be a little fatter when there is a clipping between the shoes and body in some unusual poses.
